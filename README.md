# Byanat Frontend Challenge

This project is my solution to [Byanat's](https://www.byanat.om) frontend challenge.

The objective of the challenge is to create a web application page using React that integrates Mapbox for displaying interactive maps, allow users to add markers to the map, and integrate drag-and-drop functionality.

## Project

### Brief Description

This web application shows a comprehensive list of rental stays. Users can filter by rating, stay type, or other criteria. An interactive world map details all available stays, and a search bar helps find stays in any city. A widgets section provides detailed statistics.

### Major Features:

- Interactive map.
- Filterable list of all available stays.
- Fully responsive design, adaptable to various screen sizes.
- Worldwide city search bar for quick location searches.
- Easy addition of new stays by clicking anywhere on the map.
- Sortable widgets through a simple drag-and-drop interface.
